# bech32_address/2

## Description

`bech32_address/2` is a predicate that convert a [bech32](<https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/spec/addresses/bech32#hrp-table>) encoded string into [base64](<https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>) bytes and give the address prefix, or convert a prefix \(HRP\) and [base64](<https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>) encoded bytes to [bech32](<https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/spec/addresses/bech32#hrp-table>) encoded string.

## Signature

```text
bech32_address(-Address, +Bech32) is det
bech32_address(+Address, -Bech32) is det
```

where:

- Address is a pair of the HRP \(Human\-Readable Part\) which holds the address prefix and a list of numbers ranging from 0 to 255 that represent the base64 encoded bech32 address string.
- Bech32 is an Atom or string representing the bech32 encoded string address

## Examples

### Decode Bech32 Address into its Address Pair representation

This scenario demonstrates how to parse a provided bech32 address string into its `Address` pair representation.
An `Address` is a compound term `-` with two arguments, the first being the human-readable part (Hrp) and the second
being the numeric address as a list of integers ranging from 0 to 255 representing the bytes of the address in
base 64.

Here's the steps of the scenario:

- **Given** the query:

```  prolog
bech32_address(Address, 'okp415wn30a9z4uc692s0kkx5fp5d4qfr3ac7sj9dqn').
```

- **When** the query is run
- **Then** the answer we get is:

```  yaml
height: 42
gas_used: 2222
answer:
  has_more: false
  variables: ["Address"]
  results:
  - substitutions:
    - variable: Address
      expression: "okp4-[163,167,23,244,162,175,49,162,170,15,181,141,68,134,141,168,18,56,247,30]"
```

### Decode Hrp and Address from a bech32 address

This scenario illustrates how to decode a bech32 address into the human-readable part (Hrp) and the numeric address.
The process extracts these components from a given bech32 address string, showcasing the ability to parse and
separate the address into its constituent parts.

Here's the steps of the scenario:

- **Given** the query:

```  prolog
bech32_address(-(Hrp, Address), 'okp415wn30a9z4uc692s0kkx5fp5d4qfr3ac7sj9dqn').
```

- **When** the query is run
- **Then** the answer we get is:

```  yaml
height: 42
gas_used: 2222
answer:
  has_more: false
  variables: ["Hrp", "Address"]
  results:
  - substitutions:
    - variable: Hrp
      expression: "okp4"
    - variable: Address
      expression: "[163,167,23,244,162,175,49,162,170,15,181,141,68,134,141,168,18,56,247,30]"
```

### Extract Address only for OKP4 bech32 address

This scenario demonstrates how to extract the address from a bech32 address string, specifically for a known
protocol, in this case, the okp4 protocol.

Here's the steps of the scenario:

- **Given** the query:

```  prolog
bech32_address(-(okp4, Address), 'okp415wn30a9z4uc692s0kkx5fp5d4qfr3ac7sj9dqn').
```

- **When** the query is run
- **Then** the answer we get is:

```  yaml
height: 42
gas_used: 2222
answer:
  has_more: false
  variables: ["Address"]
  results:
  - substitutions:
    - variable: Address
      expression: "[163,167,23,244,162,175,49,162,170,15,181,141,68,134,141,168,18,56,247,30]"
```

### Encode Address Pair into Bech32 Address

This scenario demonstrates how to encode an `Address` pair representation into a bech32 address string.

Here's the steps of the scenario:

- **Given** the query:

```  prolog
bech32_address(-('okp4', [163,167,23,244,162,175,49,162,170,15,181,141,68,134,141,168,18,56,247,30]), Bech32).
```

- **When** the query is run
- **Then** the answer we get is:

```  yaml
height: 42
gas_used: 2222
answer:
  has_more: false
  variables: ["Bech32"]
  results:
  - substitutions:
    - variable: Bech32
      expression: "okp415wn30a9z4uc692s0kkx5fp5d4qfr3ac7sj9dqn"
```

### Check if a bech32 address is part of the okp4 protocol

This scenario shows how to check if a bech32 address is part of the okp4 protocol.

Here's the steps of the scenario:

- **Given** the program:

```  prolog
okp4_addr(Addr) :- bech32_address(-('okp4', _), Addr).
```

- **Given** the query:

```  prolog
okp4_addr('okp41p8u47en82gmzfm259y6z93r9qe63l25dfwwng6').
```

- **When** the query is run
- **Then** the answer we get is:

```  yaml
height: 42
gas_used: 2222
answer:
  has_more: false
  results:
  - substitutions:
```

### Error on Incorrect Bech32 Address format

This scenario demonstrates the system's response to an incorrect bech32 address format.
In this case, the system generates a `domain_error`, indicating that the provided argument does not meet the
expected format for a bech32 address.

Here's the steps of the scenario:

- **Given** the query:

```  prolog
bech32_address(Address, okp4incorrect).
```

- **When** the query is run
- **Then** the answer we get is:

```  yaml
height: 42
gas_used: 2222
answer:
  has_more: false
  variables: ["Address"]
  results:
  - error: "error(domain_error(encoding(bech32),okp4incorrect),[d,e,c,o,d,i,n,g, ,b,e,c,h,3,2, ,f,a,i,l,e,d,:, ,i,n,v,a,l,i,d, ,s,e,p,a,r,a,t,o,r, ,i,n,d,e,x, ,-,1],bech32_address/2)"
```

### Error on Incorrect Bech32 Address type

This scenario demonstrates the system's response to an incorrect bech32 address type.
In this case, the system generates a `type_error`, indicating that the provided argument does not meet the
expected type.

Here's the steps of the scenario:

- **Given** the query:

```  prolog
bech32_address(-('okp4', X), foo(bar)).
```

- **When** the query is run
- **Then** the answer we get is:

```  yaml
height: 42
gas_used: 2222
answer:
  has_more: false
  variables: ["X"]
  results:
  - error: "error(type_error(atom,foo(bar)),bech32_address/2)"
```
