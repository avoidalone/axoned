## okp4d query logic ask

executes a logic query and returns the solutions found.

### Synopsis

Executes the [query] and return the solution(s) found.

Optionally, a program can be transmitted, which will be interpreted before the query is processed.

Since the query is without any side-effect, the query is not executed in the context of a transaction and no fee
is charged for this, but the execution is constrained by the current limits configured in the module (that you can
query).

```
okp4d query logic ask [query] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
$ okp4d query logic ask "chain_id(X)." # returns the chain-id
```
