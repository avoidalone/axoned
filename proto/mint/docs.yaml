  ## Function

  The Minting Module plays a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem, tasked with regulating the issuance of tokens to
  validators. This ensures the network's ongoing stability and viability. The module operates consistently, adjusting
  key parameters with each block to maintain a balanced token supply.

  ## Calculation of Inflation

  The method for determining the inflation rate is outlined in the
  [OKP4 Whitepaper - Token Model](https://docs.okp4.network/whitepaper/token-model).

  ## Per-Block Token Generation

  Given the annual inflation rate, the Minting Module calculates the exact amount of tokens to be generated for each
  block, based on the total number of blocks in a year.
